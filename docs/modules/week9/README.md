# Week 9: React and Progressive Web Apps


## React Animations

- To do animations with our React components we can write our own CSS with: `transition`, `transform` and `animation`; OR we can use some of the animations that we can import with React.

```javascript
import {TransitionGroup, CSSTransition, Transition} from 'react-transition-group';
//NOT the following
import { CSSTransitionGroup, TransitionGroup } from 'react-transition-group';
//This second one is from an OLD 1.x version
```

- Those imports will give us the needed code to add the animations.
- Then we can add them to our elements

```javascript
    
```
