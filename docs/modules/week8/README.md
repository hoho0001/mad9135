# Week 8: React Miscellaneous

## React Animations

- To do animations with our React components we can write our own CSS with: `transition`, `transform` and `animation`; OR we can use some of the animations that we can import with React.

```javascript
import {TransitionGroup, CSSTransition} from 'react-transition-group';
```

- Those imports will give us the needed code to add the animations.
- Then we can add them to our elements

```javascript

```
