# Week 10: Testing with Jest

## Why write automated tests?

- Isn't that just doubling the work for any new feature?
- Fast regression testing
  - Our code dosn't live in isolation. Changes to one module can affect many others ...
- Confident refactoring ...
- It can actually save time by focusing on one small problem at a time.

## Different kinds of tests

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end / UI tests

## Testing libraries

Test runners, asertions, coverage, mocks and fakes

- Jest
- Moca
- Chai
- Jasmine
- Karma
- Ava
- Protractor
- Nightwatch
