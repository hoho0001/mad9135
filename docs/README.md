features:
  - title: ES6, ESNext
    details: There have been a lot of features added to JavaScript (ECMA Script) in the last few years. Now these features have reached the browser and NodeJS too. Support for these features has reached a point that we can use them in production sites, or at least do less transpiling to get them working. 
  - title: React
    details: The React Framework by Facebook is an extremely powerful framework that relies on many ES6 features and can be used to create Progressive Web Apps and Single Page Applications. It can be used as a lightweight add-on for just a controlling a couple components on your website or it can be the engine behind an entire application. JSX and Redux are a couple of related topics that you need to really leverage the power of React.
  - title: React Native
    details: React Native is a close relative to React. It uses a very similar structure and set of scripts to create Hybrid Mobile applications. React Native is an alternative approach to building mobile apps from either Cordova or Native development.
