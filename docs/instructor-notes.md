## Instructor notes for Fall 2019 version of MAD9135

## Assignments

- The React Project needs to include some CRUD operations
- The webpack assignment is out of date and needs to be changed
- Maybe make PWA into the majority of the Hybrid
- Create two Hybrids one with Firebase and one with PWA?
- The React assignment and project should be changed.
- Assignment should include navigation but not forms
- Project should have the crud forms


## Modules

- students struggled with passing functions and props
- need more React notes on architecting components
- The intro to PWA should be done in MAD9022
- Add REACT to replace PWA and anything moved from first two weeks into MAD9022
- Hopefully we will have shifted a lot of the ES6 stuff into mad9022 and mad9124
- Make weeks 1 - 3 into a single week review
- More time on React
- More time on PWA... maybe make this a BIG hybrid spanning many weeks
- More time on production builds
- Add something about the Context API
- Add something about React hooks?
